# OddOwl

With multiple sports back in full swing after Christmas, the sports betting and gambling industry will continue to make profits off die-hard sports fans and adrenaline junkies.

With events such as the SuperBowl and March Madness coming up, I dove head first into the world of sports betting and was overwhelmed by the amount of bookmakers promotions, betting strategies and just pure chaotic information out there.

OddOwl is therefore created to filter out all the bloat and deliver the essentials of what you are really after, the best odds of any given match.

Using the [Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/), OddOwl aggregates your region's bookmakers and identify the best odds. In some rare cases, there is also this strategy called Arbitrage betting, where regardless of the outcome of the match, a profit can be made through a careful split of stake.
